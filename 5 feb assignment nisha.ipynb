    "with respect to object-oriented programming, a class is a template for defining objects. It specifies the names and types of variables that can exist in an object, as well as \"methods\" procedures for operating on those variables. A class can be thought of as a \"type\", \n",
    "and  the objects are being a \"variable\" of that type.and  the objects are being a \"variable\" of that type.\n",
    "basically a class describes the contents of the objects that belong to it: it describes an aggregate of data fields (called instance variables), and defines the operations (called methods). \n",
    "while an object is an element (or instance) of a class; objects have the behaviors of their class.\n",
